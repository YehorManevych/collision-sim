Physics simulation with simultaneous collision resolution method described in “Analytical methods for dynamic simulation of non-penetrating rigid bodies” (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/papers/sig89.pdf). Quadratic optimization solver uses the interior-point method, implemented from scratch in JS. Minimum search is performed via Newton's method.
